/**
 * Method overriding forms the basis for one of Javaâ€™s most powerful concepts: dynamic method dispatch.
 * Dynamic method dispatch is the mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at run time, rather than compile time.
 * it is the type of the object being referred to (not the type of the reference variable) that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.
 * Therefore, if a superclass contains a method that is overridden by a subclass,
 * then when different types of objects are referred to through a superclass reference variable,
 * different versions of the method are executed.
