1. As a Customer, I want to be able to pay for products using either British or Euro coins
- All British and Euro coins are accepted
As coins are entered, the total credit value is updated on the display screen
Mixed currency is not accepted; the first coin of the second currency entered does not contribute to the credit value and is returned to the Customer (with an explanatory message on the display screen)


Scenario: As a coin based customer, allowed to purchase product
Given snack vending machine is working as expected
When customer entered correct amount of coins for available snack update value on display for customer
Then snack machine should release snack to customer

Scenario: As a customer,  when i mix multi currency coins machine should not count second currency coins and display explanatory message
Given snack vending machine is working as expected
When customer entered currency 'one' coins update sum of coins value on display
And customer entered currency 'two' coins
Then vending machine display explanatory message on display
And return currency 'two' coins entered

=======================

2. As a coin-paying Customer, I want to be able to receive more than one product in one transaction
- After a purchase, the Customer's remaining credit is displayed on screen
The customer can either select a further item or request the credit to be returned as change

//scenario outline test multiple test data variations with test data provided in example table
Scenario outline: As a coin based customer, allowed to purchase multiple products
Given snack vending machine is working as expected
When customer entered coins display 'amount' of value to customer
And customer select snack 'one'
Then show remaining amount to customer in display
When customer choose snack 'two'
And amount remained is greater value than snack 'two'
Then snack machine should release both snacks to customer

Example:
|amount|one|two|

Scenario: As a coin based customer, allowed to purchase multiple products or return credit remained
Given snack vending machine is working as expected
When customer entered coins display 'amount' of value to customer
And customer select snack 'one'
Then show remaining amount to customer in display
And customer choose to dispense snack chosen
Then snack machine should release snack 'one' and remaining amount as displayed

Scenario: As a coin based customer, able to verify amount is not enough to purchase multiple snacks
Given snack vending machine is working as expected
When customer entered coins display 'amount' of value to customer
And customer select snack 'one'
Then show remaining amount to customer in display
When customer choose snack 'two'
And amount remained is less value than snack 'two'
Then snack machine should display customer explanatory message
And return customer remaining amount and snack 'one'

3. As a coin-paying Customer, when I request change, the money is returned to me in the smallest number of coins possible
- When change is dispensed, it is returned in the smallest number of coins; this will depend on the amount due and the stock of coins in the machine at that time
The customer is notified how much change was returned via the display screen

Scenario: As a coin based customer, allowed to purchase multiple products or return credit remained
Given snack vending machine is working as expected
When customer entered coins display 'amount' of value to customer
And customer select snack 'one'
Then show remaining amount to customer in display
And customer choose to dispense snack chosen
Then snack machine should release snack 'one'
And return customer remaining amount with available coins descending value with modular division
Then display customer returned coins amount

Question to ask: if amount of available coins not enough to return customer, do we need to stop releasing snack, return full amount of coins back to customer and show error message ?
